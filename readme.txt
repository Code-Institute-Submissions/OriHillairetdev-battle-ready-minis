Fa1. UX
1.1. Project Goals
This website was designed for the restaurant’s owner, so they can build or improve their online brand and get a wider range of customers and build loyalty. The ultimate aim of this would be to increase the sales, which we could achieve through more bookings and orders, for what we have added a call to action button to book a table in some very visible places.

This website was also designed for the public, regular and potential clients, so they can check out the menu online, find out the restaurant’s exact location or make a reservation. They would also be able to contact the restaurant for what we have added the contact details in every page of the project.

1.2. User Stories
As an owner, I want to show off what we can do to attract more clients.
As an owner, I want to offer the possibility to book online to avoid unnecessary calls during busy hours.
As an owner, I want my website to be easy recognisable through the icon in the tab and also through the name on the fixed navbar while the customers are navigating through the site.
As a user, I want to be able to get in touch with the restaurant for any reason.
As a user, I want to be able to check the opening hours and to see the restaurant's location.
As a curious user, I want to know more about the owner's stories.
As a person with an allergy, I want to be able to check out the menu in advance to see if this place is a good option for me.
As a person celebrating a special occasion, I want to be able to book a table in advance so nothing goes wrong.
