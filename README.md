2. Features

    2.1. Existing features

    The Header includes:

* Studios name: allows the user to know what studio they are dealing with.
* Navigation Bar: allows users to navigate the site in an easy and intuitive way.

    The Footer includes:

* Pricing details: A small list of the pricing used by the studio.
* Social: a collection of social media link that will take the user to those affliliated pages.
* Both the Header and the Footer are consistent throughout the website.

    2.2. Features left to implement in the future

* More technical gallery: I would like to change the gallary to a more dynamic and technical version.
* Videos: add videos of painting techniques and showcases.

3. Technologies used
    *    HTML5 - provides the content and structure for my website.
    *    CSS3 - provides the styling.
    *    Bootstrap - used to create the layout of the project.
    *    Gitpod - used to develop the website.
    *    GitHub - used to host the project.
    *    Google Fonts - used to provide the fonts Josefin Slab for the main text, and Fredericka the Great for headers.
    *    Font Awesome - used the font awesome icons to style the information and the links in the footer, and also to make the Reservation section stand out a small bit.

4. Testing

    [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)

    There where a few errors on the initial test that where easily fixed via the validation function 

    [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

    All three of the test showd an error with a paragraph ending but removal of the error caused other problems 
    to occur so it was left for convenience sake.

    Browser Testing 

    Browsers
    * Chrome
    * Edge
    * Firefox 

    Chrome and edge have no problems and loaded fast and with no problems everything was at the right scale and there where no problems 

    Firefox had a strange delay of about two seconds for all the images to load but after they wher laoded everything functioned as normal 

    Resolution and different device testing 

    This caused the most problems out of all the tests and a few of them are unresolved.
    All the tests done on my native resolution worked fine and the project was showing exactly as i had planned 

    as soon as i used the Google Dev tools i noticed a huge design flaw in the home amd gallery page 

    Home pages design flaw: 
    
    The three images intented to intice the new user and the text that followd them was not readjusting on showing as i 
    has planned on any resolution other than my own causing the entire page to turn into a confusing mess that was hard to navigate
    in addition to that the pricing section also did not adjust causing the sentances to get cut off and become impossible to read 

    this is a major flaw and will need to be addressed.

    Gallery design flaw   :
    
    while not as sevire as the home page the gallery suffers from a simmilar problem that of the images not spacing or being 
    nice to look at along with some images suddenly failing to load (seems the origonal links are dead)

    the second problem is that at cellphone portait sizes the images get cut off.

    Contact flaws         : 
    The contact page suffers the same problem as the home page and the pricing gets cut off at smaller screen sizes
    the rest of the contact pages scales and works well.
