This project was a hypothetical Miniture painting commision sight t

The very first thing that a user will see is three models painted by the commision artest 
all of the important information is on the main page so that the customer/user knows the 
pricing and wht service is renderd 

once they have absorbed all of that inforamation they can then click on the gallery tag
this takes them to a show case of work that has been done and examples of the models that they could commission 
this is simple and straight to the point showing them exactly the quality of the models that they can pay for.

once they customer is satisfied with the quality of the commision work they can click the contact tab

in the contact tab the pricing is still there and the about section had been replaced with a form 
where the user can subit their name email and what exactly they want to that they can get into contact 
with one of the commission artist via email and book thier commission

a simple website that gets the point across fast and easy.






Home page : this had more than a few errors at the start of the development cycle 
            pictures where not sizing correctly and there where muttiple times where the 
            text would refuse to lign up correctly went back to older videos and tutorials
            once i had watched them a few times i used what i had learnt there to make the 
            home page look good and clean found a handy guide for the hero picture used as the banner


Gallery page : using the very first lession to create a gallary for love running i bassed this off of the love running Gallery
                this being the most time effective way to make a gallery for myself this was simple and took the least time 



Contact page : this caused multiple problems and was a huge road bump as soon as the form was added it threw everything out of 
                alignment solution was using the correct commands in CSS to make sure all the parts play nice 

        
All images where found on google images and are used as a example and not for monitary purpose 
this is purely acidemic
